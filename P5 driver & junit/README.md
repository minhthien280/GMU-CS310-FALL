Compile with jUnit
    Using IDE: you know how to do it
    Using terminal: 
        -Put all the files in one folder
            javac -cp .:./jUnit.jar *.java
            java -cp .:./jUnit.jar P5Test
            
            
If you want to run Driver standalone use:
    java Driver [args] 
      args is a number from 1-5 (more test will be added)
